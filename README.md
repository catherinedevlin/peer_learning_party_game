# PyLadies @ PyOhio 2015

As played at the PyLadies party before [PyOhio](http://pyohio.org) 2015.

## Everything is optional

If you just want to chat and nibble, feel free to just do
that!  You can do as much or as little of this as you want.
And feel free to say, "Not now, maybe later."  
It's just meant to liven up and add variety to the 
conversation, so if you're already enjoying the conversation,
that's good enough!

## Peer Teaching

Is there some skill you'd like someone to introduce
you to?  Write "Teach Me <skill name>" on a sticker
and wear it under your nametag!

As you chat and meet others, if you see someone with
a "Teach Me" tag that you can help with, offer to 
take them to a laptop and show her the
ropes!  

Make sure the teacher doesn't do all the typing; ideally,
the learner should be the one at the keyboard.

Don't bog down too long - if you take on a big topic,
just spend a few minutes getting a quick look at the 
first stages of it, or at some particular part that
puzzles the learner.

After your lesson, feel free to wear a new tag requesting
a new topic!

### Passing it on

Research says that one of the best ways to learn is to
teach others.  So, once somebody teaches you something
at a Teach Me station, change your tag to "I'll Teach
<skill name>" and see if somebody wants to learn it from
you!  And yes, wear your "I'll Teach" badge alongside
a new "Teach Me" badge. 

### Prizes

Every time you teach a skill *or* learn a skill, put a
star on your nametag.  Before you leave for the night,
show Catherine how many stars you've earned.  On 
Saturday at PyOhio, we'll give out two prizes: 16 GB USB
drives in lovely, approximately-Pythonic green.  
One goes to the
person with the most stars, and one randomly selected
from everybody with any stars.

If someone teaches you a skill that's on their 
"I'll teach <skill>" tag, take a *bonus* star, too.
This is a bribe for you to help others solidify 
their learning with teaching!
